Liebe Leute,

We, your esteemed BMS Student Representative body, have decided that our next
social event should be a trip to the bowling alley.  The date will be this
Sunday, the 21st of May, the time will be 17:00, and the location will be
##################.  

Due to the nature of bowling alley reservations, we are in the unfortunate
position of being forced to limit the number of participants in this event to at
most 18.  Thus, we request that you reply to this email letting us know if you
are planning to come (if you're not, no reply is necessary).

Thank you!
