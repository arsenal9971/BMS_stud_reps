## <center> Follow-up session for Phase I students on Fri. 21 Apr, 2017 </center>

I will edit this later...

### BMS Office:

- BMS Office is really good.

### Student representatives:

- More parties desired, including unusual parties such as Christmas in the summer

### Diversity:

- Students generally appreciate the diverse and nice environment.

### General Satisfaction:

- Soft Skill Seminars: Generally satisfied.

(I don't know this comment was for which seminar) Uneven(?) male-female balance in number of participants.

The seminar for conflict management was helpful.

- BMS Friday: Talks with only pictures would be nice.

Some students are coming to talks they have no idea about.
(Which implies that What Is...? Seminar should attract more students?)

- Student Conference: Some students have time conflict because it is held on weekdays.

Some student suggests that more students can come to the student conference if it is held on Friday and Saturday.
Holding the conference during the semester break may attract those who cannot attend under the current schedule but may lose those who are out of town during the break.
Current schedule is better with BMS Days.

- German Courses: One in the last semester at HU was great.

The quality depends on teachers.
Good for extra 5 credits.

- Workspaces, lounges... FU Workspace needs a couch; SLEEPING ROOM WITH BLANCKTES.
FU workspace is full, possibly because it is effectively open to anyone, even outside the BMS community.
WHERE IS IT?

HU lounge; no one using it.
Only with low tables and couches. Insufficient.

Student Offices: Some students do not know how to apply for one.

- Courses: Time conflict is an issue.
Course description is not good enough for some students to access the content and difficulty.

- Regulations: Incompatibility of credits among FU and BMS. They count credits differently.
At FU, courses for bachelor, master, bms
sequence, eg topology 1, 2, 3...
consistency?

mentoring: caring?
too busy?

more advice?
One student needed one semester to be aware of need of advice

2 mentors:
mentor/student ratio uneven

master's regulations: not clear
at hu, 20 non-math credits

impression, information has not reached to students

orientation, last day explaining the master's regulation, too late
meeting mentor before is nonsense

master's regulation is in GERMAN
extended version of the regulations

UNOFFICIAL BMS WEBPAGE

confusing, contact person for the regulation at the three uni

bms office < each three uni (in efficiency in terms of master's degree)
invite contact persons to the orientation

Emphasis on the difference of the regulations of each uni

some course is not explicitly listed as a master's course
eg, bachelor
Be explicit about what could potentially be counted to fulfill requirements

conversion of credits between unis

at the other unis
course registration can be ambiguous
for bms, you can make the grades better by substituting the older ones

scholarship: rent 400eur/month, scholarship does not cover the cost of life
data
survey on the cost of living

non-eu students have to pay for health insurance

new students should get in touch with each other, some machinery suggested
eg, how to find a flat
income level too low to be eligible to rent (3 people must gather)

studentenwohnheim, no reservation for bms
house of nation
studentenwerk

INFORMATION on when to apply for an appartment/ dormitory
is lacking
