## <center> Follow-up session for Phase I students on Fri. 21 Apr, 2017 </center>

### BMS Office:

- BMS Office is really good.

### Student representatives:

- More parties desired, including unusual ones such as the Christmas party in the summer.

### Diversity:

- Students generally appreciate the nice and diverse environment.

### General Satisfaction:

- Soft Skill Seminars: Generally satisfied.

(Not sure in which seminar) Uneven male-female ratio of participants.
Conflict management was helpful.

- BMS Friday: Talks with only pictures would be nice.

Some students are coming to talks they have no idea about.
(Which implies that What Is...? Seminar should attract more students?)

- Student Conference: Some students have time conflict because it is held on weekdays.

Some student suggests that more students can come to the conference if it is held on Friday and Saturday.
Holding the conference during the semester break may attract those who cannot attend under the current schedule (but may lose those who are out of town during the break).
Current schedule is better integrated with BMS Days.

- German Courses: One in the last semester at HU was great.

The quality depends on teachers.
Good for extra 5 credits at HU.

- Lounges: FU Workspace needs a couch. Nap rooms desired.

FU workspace is full, possibly because it is effectively open to anyone, even outside the BMS community.
WHERE IS IT?

No one is using the HU lounge.
Only with low tables and couches. Insufficient facilities.

Student Offices: Some students do not know how to apply for one.

- Courses: Time conflict is an issue.
Course description is not good enough for some students to access the level of contents.

- BMS Regulations: Incompatibility of credits among FU and BMS. They count credits differently.
Some BMS Basic courses are counted as bachelor courses at FU.

- Mentoring: Some mentors are too busy or take too many students.
It is good for students to be able to change mentors.
It might be a good idea to take 2 mentors per student.

Some students spent one semester to be aware that they appreciate advice.

- Master's regulations: Not clearly explained or information lacking.
At hu, 20 non-math credits are required.

During the orientation, it is too late to explain the master's regulation on the last day.
Meeting a mentor before that is nonsense.

Master's regulations are in GERMAN.
An extended english version of the regulations is desired.

Asking contact persons about the regulations at the three universities is more efficient than asking BMS Office.
It may be a good idea to invite contact persons to the orientation.

Differences of the regulations of the three universities should be emphasized.

At FU, Some courses are not explicitly listed as master's courses, e.g. some bachelor courses may be counted as Master's courses.
Clarify what could potentially be counted to fulfill requirements.

Conversion of credits between universities.

Students registered at FU or HU can take an advantage of not having to register for courses via the system.
TU students can decide to take final exams at the end of semester but FU or HU students have to take exams or fail courses.

For BMS, it is not well known that one can improve grades, repeating courses.

Regulations and practical advice to deal with them might fit UNOFFICIAL BMS WEBSITE.

- Phase I Scholarship: Rent 400 eur/month, scholarship does not really cover the cost of living.
A survey on the cost of living should clarify how much students actually spend monthly.

Inequality between EU citizins and non-EU citizens.
Health insurance is not negligible.

The income level is too low to be eligible to rent (At least 3 students must gather).

- Misc.: New students should get in touch with each other to exchange information, e.g. how to find a flat.

In general, housing is a big issue.
How and when to apply the dormitory?
Studentenwohnheime, no reservation for BMS (Some programs, e.g. Erasmus, have reservation).
Information on house of nations, studentenwerk, etc... should be spread out.
