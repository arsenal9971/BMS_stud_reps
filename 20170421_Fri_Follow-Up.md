## <center> Follow-up session for Phase I students on Fri. 21 Apr, 2017 </center>

### 1. BMS Office
- BMS Office is really good.
### 2. Student representatives
- More parties desired, including unusual ones such as the Christmas party in the summer.
### 3. Diversity
- Students generally appreciate the nice and diverse environment.
### 4. General Satisfaction
  #### 1. Soft Skill Seminars
  - Generally satisfied.
  - (Not sure about which seminar) Uneven male-female ratio of participants.
  - Conflict management was helpful.
  #### 2. BMS Friday
  - Talks with only pictures would be nice.
  - Some students are coming to talks they have no idea about. (Which implies that What Is...? Seminar should attract more students?)
  #### 3. Student Conference
  - Some students have time conflict because it is held on weekdays.
  - Some student suggests that more students can come to the conference if it is held on Friday and Saturday.
  - Holding the conference during the semester break may attract those who cannot attend under the current schedule (but may lose those who are out of town during the break).
  - Current schedule is better integrated with BMS Days.
  #### 4. German Courses
  - One in the last semester at HU was great.
  - The quality depends on teachers.
  - Good for extra 5 credits at HU.
  #### 5. Lounges
  - FU Workspace needs a couch.
  - Nap rooms desired.
  - FU workspace is full, possibly because it is effectively open to anyone, even outside the BMS community.
  - WHERE IS IT?
  - No one is using the HU lounge.
  - Only with low tables and couches. Insufficient facilities.
  #### 6. Student Offices
  - Some students do not know how to apply for one.
  #### 7. Courses
  - Time conflict is an issue.
  - Course descriptions are not good enough for some students to access the level of contents.
  #### 8. BMS Regulations
  - Incompatibility of credits among FU and BMS. They count credits differently.
  - Some BMS Basic courses are counted as Bachelor courses at FU.
  #### 9. Mentoring
  - Some mentors are too busy or take too many students.
  - It is good for students to be able to change mentors.
  - It might be a good idea to assign 2 mentors per student, upon request.
  - Some student spent one semester to be aware of usefulness of advice.
  #### 10. Master's Regulations
  - Not clearly explained or information lacking.
  - At HU, 20 non-math credits are required.
  - During the orientation, it is too late to explain the master's regulations on the last day.
  - Meeting a mentor before that is nonsense.
  - Master's regulations are in GERMAN.
  - An extended english version of the regulations is desired.
  - Asking contact persons about the regulations at the three universities is more efficient than asking BMS Office.
  - It may be a good idea to invite contact persons to the orientation.
  - Differences of the regulations of the three universities should be emphasized.
  - At FU, Some courses are not explicitly listed as Master's courses, e.g. some bachelor courses may be counted as Master's courses.
  - Clarify what could potentially be counted to fulfill requirements.
  - Conversion of credits between universities.
  - Students registered at FU or HU can take an advantage of not having to register for courses via the system.
  - TU students can decide to take final exams at the end of the semester but FU or HU students have to take exams or fail courses.
  - For BMS, it is not well known that one can improve grades, repeating courses.
  - Regulations and practical advice to deal with them might fit UNOFFICIAL BMS WEBSITE.
  #### 11. Phase I Scholarship
  - Rent 400 eur/month, scholarship does not really cover the cost of living.
  - A survey should clarify how much students actually spend monthly.
  - Inequality between EU citizins and non-EU citizens, e.g. Health insurance is not negligible.
  - The income level is too low to be eligible to rent (At least 3 students must gather).
  #### 12. Misc.
  - New students should get in touch with each other to exchange information, e.g. how to find a flat.
  - In general, housing is a big issue.
  - How and when to apply the dormitory?
  - Studentenwohnheime, no reservation for BMS (Some programs, e.g. Erasmus, have reservation).
  - Information on house of nations, studentenwerk, etc... should be spread out.
